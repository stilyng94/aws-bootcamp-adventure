# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

- Application: Cruddur
- Cohort: 2023-A1
- Paul Osei Kofi

Week 0 started slowly, as I could not join the live stream. I caught it later in the week to watch most of the videos. Despite my current level, I was lost for the most part since I barely do stuff related to coming up with architectural designs and all things surrounding it.

I already had an AWS account, so things like creating an IAM user and getting credentials were a breeze. The only challenge was buying a domain. I added a Billing alarm and created a budget, and I will say all the things needed on AWS for week one. I managed to get them to work.
